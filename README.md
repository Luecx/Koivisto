Koivisto is a strong chess engine written primarily by Kim KÃ¥hre and Finn Eggers in c++. Koivisto in itself is not a complete chess program and requires a UCI-compatible graphical user interface.

### Supported UCI settings:
- Hash
- SyzygyPath (up to 6 pieces)
- Threads (up to 256)

# Compiling


Note that compiler warnings might pop up which can be safely ignored and will most likely be fixed in 
one of the future releases.

## Windows / Linux


We do provide binaries for Windows / Linux systems. You can download them for each release after Koivisto 3.0 [here](https://github.com/Luecx/Koivisto/releases). 
Note that we **strongly recommend** that you build the binaries yourself for best performance.
Assuming build tools have been installed, one can type:

```
git clone https://github.com/Luecx/Koivisto.git
cd Koivisto/

cd src_files
make pgo
```

Besides compiling a native version which should be best in terms of performance, one can also compile static executables using:
```
cd src_files
make release
```

#### MacOS

We do not provide binaries for MacOS yet.
